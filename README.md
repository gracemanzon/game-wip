# Dinosaur Game

A browser based mini game is inspired by the 1998 iMac game Nanosaur. The players goal is to collect eggs from each dinosaur species and relocate them to a homebase. This MVP features base mechanics and physics allowing the player to navigate and platform through the map and avoid collision with the enemy dinosaurs. The player will take damage if colliding with enemy dinosaurs and will be reset to the beginning of the map if the entire health bar is drained.

- Single scene application written in Javascript
- Utilizes the Phaser 2 framework to build arcade physics and accept keyboard input
- Features original artwork for spritesheets and tileset

## Roadmap

The overall vision for the game is quite a bit more expansive. Featuring multiple levels each with their own unique themes and dinosaur species, a player attack and healing system as well as a time restriction to complete.
